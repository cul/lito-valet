Access to the offsite request system now requires a one-time registration. 
To request registration please send email to 
<strong>recapregistration@library.columbia.edu</strong>
indicating your uni.
We will contact you when the registration is complete or if we need additional information. 


<!--
Your uni (<%= current_user.login %>) is not eligible to place offsite requests.
<br>
<br>
The following page will advise you on what to do to establish ReCAP request capability.

<div class='offset-block'>

</div>

You may also visit a library service desk to speak with someone about making an offsite request.
