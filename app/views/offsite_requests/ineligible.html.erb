<h4>Faculty, students, staff, and visitors with borrowing privileges</h4>

Access to the offsite request system requires an active borrowing account in good standing. Outstanding library fees of $100 or higher on your account block your ability to borrow materials from on-campus libraries and offsite. Check your library borrowing account at
<strong>
<a href='http://www.columbia.edu/cgi-bin/cul/resolve?lweb0087' target='_blank'>http://www.columbia.edu/cgi-bin/cul/resolve?lweb0087</a>
</strong>
. You will be able to place offsite requests when billed items have been returned and discharged from your library account. If they are indeed lost, there will be a replacement fee of $100 per item. To make payment for lost materials or ask questions about your library account, send email to the Library Information Office at

or visit 201 Butler Library.
